        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi there! My name is Jayden Gillam, and I am a Computer Science Major at 
            Ball State University. I grew up in Windfall, Indiana, a small town near 
            Kokomo, and went to nearby Tri-Central High School. Computer science and 
            programming have always been subjects of interest to me. My dad is a 
            programmer (and Ball State Grad *chirp chirp*), and I was always interested 
            in his work, but it wasn't until I took a Computer Science class in high 
            school that my interest became my career goal.
        </p>
